- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Winfield! I'm a junior at the University of Southern California studying biomedical engineering with a computer programming minor!
- ðŸ‘€ I've learned programming languages such as Python, Java, and MATLAB. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm super passionate about conducting research! My current research project involves tracking asymmetric hematapoeitic stem cell division (HSC) to better understand HSC division patterns. My previous work includes creating a rapid quantification method using MATLAB to quantify migration characteristis of cell chemotaxis, manufacturing microfluidic devices for cancer tissue engineering, and screening drug candidates for inhibition of biochemical process responsible for the causing ALS in patients.
